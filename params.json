{"name":"HKUST Smart Car Library","tagline":"Sentinel is the best","body":"USTSmartcar\r\n===========\r\n![Team Logo](http://i.imgur.com/yuj3QYG.png)\r\n\r\nThis is a library developed by the HKUST Robotics team for the SmartCar Competition. \r\nCompiles in the IAR IDE for the Freescale k60 MCU on a custom made development board.\r\n\r\nFirst Started in 2012.\r\n\r\nGyroscope, Accelerometer, encoders and Linear CCD libraries are also written for input.\r\n\r\nConventions\r\n-----------\r\nThis library attempts to follow the following conventions:\r\n\r\n1.If your function is part of a Hardware Ability:\r\n- have it live inside of a library eventually ( i.e `accl.c`, `accl.h`)\r\n\r\n2.Prefix all functions with library name:\r\n- i.e. `accl_tilt();`\r\n\r\n3.for global variables, affix g_ to the front of the variable, and label the type with f,u8,ch etc.\r\n- i.e. `g_u8ar_ccd_pixel` would mean it is a global variable with type u8 array called pixel, related to the ccd library,\r\n- this allows code to be self documenting and easier to read\r\n\r\n4.With the exception of special deployment scenarios, (i.e. pintest), refrain from defining functions inside of main.c, \r\n- increase readability. \r\n- try to place them in their own .h & .c files\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nLibrary built and maintained by @jcching, @LouisMo, @city25\r\nMagnetic branch maintained by @fyuac, @benjaminlair18\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with this library? No support from us, but we tried commenting the code thoroughly","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
