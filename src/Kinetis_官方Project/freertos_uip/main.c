/*
 * Creates all the demo application tasks, then starts the scheduler.  The WEB
 * documentation provides more details of the standard demo application tasks
 * (which just exist to test the kernel port and provide an example of how to use
 * each FreeRTOS API function).
 *
 * In addition to the standard demo tasks, the following tasks and tests are
 * defined and/or created within this file:
 *
 * "Check" hook -  This only executes fully every five seconds from the tick
 * hook.  Its main function is to check that all the standard demo tasks are
 * still operational.  The status can be viewed using on the Task Stats page
 * served by the WEB server.
 *
 * "uIP" task -  This is the task that handles the uIP stack.  All TCP/IP
 * processing is performed in this task.
 *
 * "USB" task - Enumerates the USB device as a CDC class, then echoes back all
 * received characters with a configurable offset (for example, if the offset
 * is 1 and 'A' is received then 'B' will be sent back).  A dumb terminal such
 * as Hyperterminal can be used to talk to the USB task.
